/**
 * Outline the tool contract here.
 * - Specify the fields every tool must implement (name, description, schema, `execute`).
 * - Document how tools report success vs. failure and how they should format observations for the LLM.
 * - Provide helper Zod schemas for reusable argument patterns (file path, code block, shell command, etc.).
 * - Mention any safety validations (path normalization, workspace boundaries) that tool authors must follow.
