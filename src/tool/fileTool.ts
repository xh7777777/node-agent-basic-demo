/**
 * Describe the file authoring tool here.
 * - Implement a tool that can create or update files by applying patches suggested by the LLM.
 * - Arguments should include `targetPath`, `intentSummary`, and either a full file body or a set of patch hunks.
 * - Enforce workspace boundaries, auto-create directories, and emit a diff preview for the observation.
 * - Support "comment-only scaffolding" mode so the agent can gradually turn instructions into real code.
