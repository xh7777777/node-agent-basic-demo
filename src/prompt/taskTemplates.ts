/**
 * Document task-specific prompt snippets here.
 * - Provide a template that asks the agent to implement a Snake game via iterative file creation.
 * - Capture acceptance criteria: keyboard controls, score tracking, restart behavior, HTML/CSS/TS stack, etc.

 * - Export helper functions that merge these templates with the base system prompt.
